- Activation Functions: Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) and Sigmoid activation function
- Binary Cross-Entropy Loss function
- Mean Square error loss
- Huber loss

<ins>Part B includes:</ins>
- Confusion Matrix
- Training and Validation Losses
- Preprocessing Techniques: Normalization and One-Hot Encoding
